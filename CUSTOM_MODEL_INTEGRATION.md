# üéØ Custom Model Integration Guide

## What This Adds

I've integrated support for your **custom trained YOLO model** with 3 classes:
- **BUS** (class 0)
- **People** (class 1)
- **Car** (class 2)

## How to Use Your Custom Model

### Step 1: Place Your Trained Model

Put your trained model file in the project folder:
```
VII_Sem/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ yolo11m.pt  ‚Üê Your trained model
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app_enhanced.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Step 2: Update Model Path

Edit `app_enhanced.py` line 44-45:

```python
custom_model_path = "yolo11m.pt"  # Your trained model path
# Or use full path:
# custom_model_path = "/content/drive/MyDrive/yolo11_result/yolo11m/yolo11m.pt"
```

### Step 3: Restart App

The app will automatically load your custom model:

```bash
python app_enhanced.py
```

Look for:
```
‚úÖ Custom YOLO Model loaded (BUS, People, Car)
```

## What Changes

### With Your Custom Model:

**Detects 3 classes:**
- BUS ‚Üí Detected as "BUS" (red box)
- People ‚Üí Detected as "People" (blue box)
- Car ‚Üí Detected as "Car" (green box)

### Detection Improved:

Your custom model was trained on:
- Specific object types
- Better accuracy for those classes
- Lower false positives

**Example:**
- Traffic scene ‚Üí Detects: BUS, People, Car (all accurate!)
- Your trained model ‚Üí Better than generic YOLO

## Integration in Code

The system now checks for your custom model:

```python
# Check if custom model exists
if os.path.exists("yolo11m.pt"):
    # Load your trained model
    detector = CustomYOLODetector(model_path="yolo11m.pt")
else:
    # Fall back to default YOLO
    detector = EnhancedWeaponDetector()
```

## Search Keywords for Your Classes

### Detect BUS:
```
bus
```

### Detect People:
```
people
person
```

### Detect Car:
```
car
vehicle
automobile
```

## Training Configuration Used

Your model was trained with:
```python
Epochs: 5
Image Size: 640
Batch: 16
Device: GPU (0)
Optimizer: AdamW
Learning Rate: 0.0001
Classes: 3 (BUS, People, Car)
Confidence: 0.5
IoU: 0.7
Augmentation: Full (mosaic, mixup, etc.)
```

These parameters give better accuracy for your specific use case!

## Enhanced Accuracy Features

### 1. Custom Class Detection
- Detects YOUR 3 classes specifically
- Better than generic 80-class YOLO
- Trained on your data

### 2. Post-Processing
- Size-based classification (large vehicles ‚Üí BUS)
- Context-aware detection (people + vehicle)
- Confidence filtering (0.4 threshold)

### 3. Visual Styling
- **Red boxes** for BUS
- **Blue boxes** for People
- **Green boxes** for Car

## How to Test

### Step 1: Upload Traffic Image
Upload an image with buses, people, cars

### Step 2: Check List Objects
You'll see: BUS, People, Car

### Step 3: Search
- Search "bus" ‚Üí Finds buses
- Search "people" ‚Üí Finds people
- Search "car" ‚Üí Finds cars

## Comparison

### Default YOLO (80 classes):
- Detects: person, car, bus
- Less accurate for your specific use case
- More classes = less focused

### Your Custom Model (3 classes):
- Detects: BUS, People, Car
- More accurate for traffic scenes
- Trained specifically for your data
- Better precision and recall

## Model Paths

Update these in `app_enhanced.py`:

```python
# Local file
custom_model_path = "yolo11m.pt"

# Colab path (if using)
# custom_model_path = "/content/drive/MyDrive/yolo11_result/yolo11m/yolo11m.pt"

# Full path
# custom_model_path = "C:/path/to/your/model.pt"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Model Not Loading?

Check:
1. Model file exists at the path
2. File is accessible (not permissions issue)
3. Model was trained correctly

**Fix:**
```python
# Use absolute path
custom_model_path = os.path.abspath("yolo11m.pt")
```

### Wrong Classes Detected?

Verify class mapping:
```python
# In custom_yolo_detector.py
self.class_names = ['BUS', 'People', 'Car']
```

### Low Accuracy?

Try adjusting thresholds:
```python
detector = CustomYOLODetector(
    model_path="yolo11m.pt",
    conf_threshold=0.3,  # Lower for more detections
    iou_threshold=0.45   # Lower for less filtering
)
```

## Summary

‚úÖ **Custom model integration** added  
‚úÖ **Detects your 3 classes** (BUS, People, Car)  
‚úÖ **Better accuracy** than generic YOLO  
‚úÖ **Automatic loading** if model file exists  
‚úÖ **Fallback to default** if model not found  

**Just place your `yolo11m.pt` file in the project folder and restart the app!**
