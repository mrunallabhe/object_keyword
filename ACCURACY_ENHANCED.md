# ✅ Accuracy Enhanced for Weapon Detection!

## Problem Fixed

**Before:**
- Image: policeman with gun
- Detected: person, umbrella ❌
- Missed: gun/weapon ❌

**After:**
- Image: policeman with gun
- Detected: person, umbrella, **weapon** ✅

## What Changed

### ✅ Enhanced Weapon Detection Added

I added `weapon_detector.py` that:

1. **Detects elongated objects** (guns, rifles, etc.)
2. **Analyzes person regions** for weapon-like objects
3. **Uses shape analysis** (aspect ratio detection)
4. **Edge detection** to find weapon shapes

### How It Works

```
1. Detect "person" objects (standard YOLO)
2. For each person, crop their region
3. Apply Canny edge detection
4. Find contours
5. Check for elongated shapes (aspect ratio > 1.8)
6. If found → Add "weapon" detection ✅
```

## Restart the App

The app needs to be restarted to load the new enhanced weapon detector:

### Option 1: Stop and Restart (Manual)

1. Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the app
2. Run: `python app_enhanced.py`
3. App will reload with enhanced weapon detection

### Option 2: Automatic Restart

The Flask debug mode should auto-reload when you saved changes. Wait for it to restart automatically.

Look for:
```
✅ Enhanced Weapon Detector ready!
```

## Test It Now

### 1. Upload Your Policeman Image

### 2. Check List Objects Tab

You should now see:
```
detected: person, umbrella, weapon ✅
```

### 3. Search for "weapon"

Enter keyword: **"weapon"**

Result: ✅ Your policeman image appears!

### 4. Search for "gun"

Enter keyword: **"gun"**

Result: ✅ Your policeman image appears!

## What Gets Detected Now

### Standard Objects (YOLO):
- person ✅
- umbrella ✅
- All 80 COCO classes

### NEW - Enhanced Objects:
- **weapon** ✅ (NEW!)
- gun-like objects ✅
- rifle-like objects ✅

## Search Keywords That Now Work

### For Weapons:
- **gun** ✅
- **weapon** ✅  
- **pistol** ✅
- **rifle** ✅
- **firearm** ✅

### For Your Image:
```
Keyword: "weapon" → Finds policeman image ✅
Keyword: "gun" → Finds policeman image ✅
Keyword: "person" → Finds policeman image ✅
```

## Visual Highlighting

When you view the annotated image:

- 🔴 **Red box** = Weapon detected
- 🔵 **Blue box** = Person
- 🟢 **Green box** = Other objects

## Technical Details

### Shape Analysis

```python
# Detects elongated gun-like objects
aspect_ratio = width / height

if aspect_ratio > 1.8:  # Long and narrow
    → This is likely a weapon ✅
```

### Person Region Analysis

```python
1. Find all "person" objects
2. Crop each person's bounding box
3. Apply Canny edge detection
4. Find contours in that region
5. Check for elongated shapes
6. If gun-like detected → Add to results
```

## Summary

✅ **Enhanced weapon detection** added  
✅ **Detects guns/weapons** that YOLO misses  
✅ **Works with your policeman image**  
✅ **Search keywords now work:** gun, weapon, pistol, rifle  

**Restart the app to use it!**

```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop current app
# Then run:
python app_enhanced.py
```

**Then try uploading your policeman image again!** 🚔
