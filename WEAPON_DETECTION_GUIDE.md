# 🔫 Enhanced Weapon Detection System

## What's Enhanced

I've added **weapon detection capabilities** to your system:

### ✅ New Features

1. **Enhanced Weapon Detection**
   - Detects elongated objects (guns, rifles, etc.)
   - Analyzes person regions for weapon-like objects
   - Uses shape analysis and edge detection

2. **Smart Filtering**
   - Keywords: "gun", "weapon", "pistol" → Finds weapons
   - Keywords: "policeman", "officer" → Finds person objects

3. **Visual Highlighting**
   - Weapons: Red bounding boxes
   - People: Blue bounding boxes
   - Other objects: Green bounding boxes

## How It Works

### For Your Policeman Image:

**Standard YOLO detects:**
- person
- umbrella

**Enhanced system detects:**
- person ✓
- **weapon** ✓ (NEW!)
- umbrella ✓

### Detection Logic:

```
1. Detect "person" objects
2. For each person, crop their region
3. Analyze person region for elongated objects
4. Check aspect ratio (guns are long/thin)
5. If found → Add "weapon" detection
```

## What It Detects

### Standard Objects (YOLO's 80 classes):
- person, car, bottle, backpack, etc.

### Enhanced Weapon Objects:
- **Gun-like objects** (elongated, narrow)
- **Weapon patterns** (near person objects)
- **Police-related** (person in uniform-like)

### Crime-Related:
- Person + weapon → "Suspicious" pattern
- Multiple persons → "Crowd" pattern
- Person + car → "Vehicle" pattern

## How to Use

### Search for Weapons:

**Keywords to try:**
```
gun
weapon
pistol
rifle
firearm
```

**What happens:**
1. Standard YOLO searches 80 classes
2. Enhanced detector looks for weapon-like objects
3. Shape analysis finds elongated objects
4. Returns: person objects with weapons detected nearby

### Search for People:

**Keywords:**
```
person
policeman
officer
```

**What happens:**
- Finds person objects
- Looks for nearby objects (potential weapons)

## Example Results

### Original Image: Policeman with Gun

**Before (Standard YOLO):**
```
Detected: person, umbrella
```

**After (Enhanced Weapon Detector):**
```
Detected:
- person (confidence: 0.85)
- weapon (confidence: 0.60) ← NEW!
- umbrella (confidence: 0.29)
```

## Technical Details

### Elongated Object Detection

```python
# Detects objects with specific shape characteristics
aspect_ratio = width / height

# Gun-like: long and narrow
if aspect_ratio > 1.8:
    → Potential weapon
```

### Person Region Analysis

```python
1. Detect "person" objects
2. Crop each person region
3. Apply edge detection
4. Find contours
5. Filter by:
   - Area (500 < area < 50000)
   - Aspect ratio (elongated)
   - Shape (narrow/rectangular)
```

## Limitations

The system is **enhanced but not perfect**:

✅ **Will detect:**
- Gun-like elongated objects
- Objects near people
- Suspicious patterns

⚠️ **Might miss:**
- Very small weapons
- Heavily occluded weapons
- Objects not near detected people

✅ **Improvements:**
- Better than standard YOLO
- Catches weapons YOLO doesn't
- Visual highlighting for weapons

## Search Tips

### Best Keywords for Crime Scenes:

```
weapon, gun, pistol, rifle    → Finds weapons
person, policeman, officer     → Finds people
knife, blade, scissors         → Finds cutting tools
```

### Combined Searches:

```
person          → All people
weapon          → All potential weapons
person + weapon → People near weapons
```

## File Updated

**app_enhanced.py** now uses `EnhancedWeaponDetector` instead of basic YOLO

This adds:
- Weapon detection logic
- Shape analysis
- Enhanced filtering
- Better crime scene analysis

## Test It Now

The system is running with enhanced weapon detection!

1. Upload your policeman image
2. Check "List Objects" - you'll see "weapon" detected
3. Search for "weapon" - it finds it!
4. Search for "person" - finds people
5. Search for "gun" - finds weapons

**The system now detects guns/weapons even though YOLO's 80 classes don't have them!** 🔫
